 * Fowler/Noll/Vo hash
 *
 * The basis of this hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
 * as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by:
 *
 *      Phong Vo (http://www.research.att.com/info/kpv/)
 *      Glenn Fowler (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/)
 *
 * In a subsequent ballot round:
 *
 *      Landon Curt Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)
 *
 * improved on their algorithm.  Some people tried this hash
 * and found that it worked rather well.  In an EMail message
 * to Landon, they named it the ``Fowler/Noll/Vo'' or FNV hash.
 *
 * FNV hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low
 * collision rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots
 * of data while maintaining a reasonable collision rate.
